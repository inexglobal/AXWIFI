# AXWiFi Library

Arduino Library for AXWiFi

## How to use:

1. Download the source from the git https://github.com/Teerawut101/AXWiFi

2. copy the AXWiFi folder to your arduino default library. Your Arduino library folder should now look like this  
   (on Windows): [arduino installation directory]
        Arduino\libraries\
   (on MACOS): [arduino Package Contents]
        ~/Documents/Arduino/libraries/

3. Open the Arduino Application. (If it's already open, you will need to restart it to see changes.)

4. Click "File-> Examples". Here are some test programs in "AXWiFi->"

5. Depending on the type of board you're using, you need to modify the header file to match.
   For example, if you're using a AXWiFi. 
   You just `#include <AXWIFI.h>`
